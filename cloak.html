<h1>rx - how to get a cloak</h1>
<p>A cloak is a custom virtual host that replaces your current host or IP address shown in join/part/quit messages and in <code>/WHOIS</code>.  For example, <code>someone@10-10-32-1.res.dsl.example.com</code> might appear as <code>someone@someone.netuser.irc.andrewyu.org</code>.</p>

	The Atheme database got dumped so you can't use HostServ now. Just ask staff.

</p>

<h2>Getting a user cloak</h2>
<p>User cloaks are in the form <code>(your account name).netuser.irc.andrewyu.org</code> and it is assumed that you have <a href="/nickserv.html">already registered your nickname</a>.<br/>
To get a user cloak, simply send the following:</p>
<pre><code>/MSG HostServ TAKE $account.netuser.irc.andrewyu.org</code></pre>
<p><b>Note: Don't substitute <code>$account</code>.  Services will automatically substitute it with your account name.</b></p>

<h2>(Not) Protecting your identity</h2>
<p>While cloaks may look nicer than raw hostmasks/IP addresses, they're not meant to be used for protecting your identity.  Cloaks will replace your IP/host when connected, but there are a few exceptions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If not using SASL, cloaks won't be set until you log in</li>
	<li>If services are down, no cloaks will be set at all</li>
	<li>Network administrators can see real hosts/IP addresses at any time</li>
</ul>
<p>If these exceptions are fine, you may use cloaks.  Else, you shouldn't connect to the internet from this IP in the first place.<br/>
If you wish to protect your identity, connect from <a href="https://torproject.org">Tor</a> instead.</p>

<h2>Different kinds of cloak</h2>
<p>Other kinds of cloaks are also set.  Most of them cannot be requested, but they're still listed for convienience:</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>netadmin.irc.andrewyu.org</code>: indicates that the user is a network administrator</li>
	<li><code>[user].tor.gateway.irc.andrewyu.org</code>: indicates that the user is connecting from Tor</li>
	<li><code>[user].xmpp.ugateway.irc.andrewyu.org</code>: indicates that the user is connecting from an unaffiliated XMPP-to-IRC gateway</li>
</ul>

<h2>Removing your cloak</h2>
<p>Just send the following to HostServ:</p>
<pre><code>/MSG HostServ DROP</code></pre>
<p>Or if you wish to just temporarily disable it:</p>
<pre><code>/MSG HostServ OFF</code></pre>
<p>And turn it on again with:</p>
<pre><code>/MSG HostServ ON</code></pre>

<h2>Need help?</h2>
<p>You may run the following:</p>
<pre><code>/MSG HostServ HELP</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, we're available in the <code>#support</code> channel for any questions that may arise.</p>
